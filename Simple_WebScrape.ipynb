The below code shows that I created functions that use the soup object with the url to identify all the a tags by key words: programs-surveys, newsroom, data, and library as they are identified in the leading part of the URI.  Once the link is identified, the leading portion of the URL address is joined with urljoin.  This converts the relative URL to an Absolute URL.\n",
